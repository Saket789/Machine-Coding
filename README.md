# The Challenge

Rent different kinds of vehicles such as cars and bikes.


# Features:

Rental service has multiple branches throughout the city.
Each branch has a limited number of different kinds of vehicles.
Each vehicle can be booked with a predefined fixed price.
Each vehicle can be booked in multiples of 1-hour slots each. (For simplicity, assume slots of a single day)


# Requirements:

Onboard a new branch with available vehicles.
Onboard new vehicle(s) of an existing type to a particular branch.
Rent a vehicle for a time slot and a vehicle type(the lowest price as the default choice extendable to any other strategy).
Display available vehicles for a given branch sorted on price.
The vehicle will have to be dropped at the same branch where it was picked up. **Bonus question:**7. Dynamic pricing â€“ demand vs supply. If 80% of cars in a particular branch are booked, increase the price by 10%.
